# Fractol

Fractol is a graphic project which with the help of an external library (minilibx) renders and manipulate a Mandelbrot and Julia set.

## Minilibx

Minilibx is an abstraction layer for the X11 library. It offers various functions which not only facilitate the creation and use of screens, windows, and images, but also the event management and maks subscriptions.

It works similarly to X11: it connects to the graphics server by opening a display and creates windows and images. It makes the management of mouse and keyboard events easier and allows you to listen them automatically, managing mask subscriptions.
